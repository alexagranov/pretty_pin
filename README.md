base34
======
base34 is currently just a simple module for mixing in methods to convert between base10 and base34 numbers.

Applications of base34 could include, but are not limited to:
- gift/promotion/discount/redemption code generation
- much shorter string representation of long decimal strings, such as a UUID

Examples to come soon...
